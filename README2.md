## Overview: 

Paper goods are the primary focus of the American business Parch & Posey. It employs fifty sales reps in all, who work in four US regions. Standard paper, glossy paper, and poster paper are the three types of paper that the company sells. Finding significant trends that can help with client retention, product promotion, sales growth, and well-informed company decisions is the goal of this analysis.

## Aim Of The Analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to gain valuable insights from the Companyâ€™s data and improve its sales performance.

## Data: 
The CSV files were loaded into the Posey database using Bash scripting. The database contains five tables: regions, orders, sales_reps, web_events, and accounts.
  
## Data Cleaning:
The data type for each column in the tables was modified to the appropriate type. Null values in the standard_qty, gloss_qty, and poster_qty columns of the orders table were replaced with 0. SQL query for data_cleaning can be found [here](Data_cleaning.md) No duplicate records were found in the database.

# Tool Used: 
PostgreSQL was used for explorative analysis of the database.

# Notable Business Questions:
