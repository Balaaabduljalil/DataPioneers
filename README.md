# Overview: 
Paper goods are the primary focus of the American business Parch & Posey. It employs fifty sales reps in all, who work in four US regions. Standard paper, glossy paper, and poster paper are the three types of paper that the company sells. Finding significant trends that can help with client retention, product promotion, sales growth, and well-informed company decisions is the goal of this analysis.
# Data: 
The data underwent a comprehensive cleaning process prior to analysis. Every blank and duplication was removed. PostgreSQL was used for exploratory data analysis with the goal of minimizing revenue loss and optimizing revenue and sales. The CSV formatted results of the SQL queries were extracted, redirected, and entered into the visualization tool.

These four tables are found in the database of the Parch and Posey data company.
